; Change HTTPBaseFolder to locate where the CAR assets are distributed.
; Make sure all ports (RouterPort, SimulatorPort, HTTPListenPort) are available and open

;You can change this to specify a particular address for the simulator for this
;server. If it is blank (the default), the address that the router receives the
;connection is used. This should be fine for most setups.
;SimulatorAddress=127.0.0.1

;You can bind the server to a single IP address by setting this value (often to the same
;as Simulator address above). This is useful when running multiple servers on the same
;computer (each with their own IP address). This method does NOT require client modifications
;BindAddress=127.0.0.1

; For the HTTP server, this is the base folder that contains the file structure for the
; game assets, to be distributed to clients that require them.
; For example, if the client requests the following file:
;     \Release\Current\EarthEternal.car
; And HTTPBaseFolder is set to this exact path:
;     C:\Games\EEProject86
; Then this file must exist in the exact path:
;     C:\Games\EEProject86\Release\Current\EarthEternal.car
